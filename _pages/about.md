i! I'm a researcher on computational cancer mechanics.

In the last years, my research has focused on the study of neuroblastoma, the most common and letal extracranial paediatric cancer in childhood. My computational models have helped to understand the key mechanisms involved in the different stages of cancer progression and metastasis. I have developed multiple models at both cellular and tissue-scale that serve as tools for clinical and experimental research. 

The main objective of my research career is the development of computational models based on experimental research and clinical data that provide new tools in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. 

In particular, my current interests include the following lines of research: study of the mechanisms that trigger tumour mass initiation, development of patient-specific models that analyse tumour evolution and response to treatment based on patient data, analysis of cellular forces during metastasis and study of cell migration during intra and extravasation processes.
